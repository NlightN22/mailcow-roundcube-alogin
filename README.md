# mailcow-roundcube-alogin
Updated scripts for logging to Roundcube from mailcow admin panel

Original scripts here - https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2038244 . Thanks for author!

I made changes, because i get some problems with SSL, and hostname. 
In original script author take mailcow_hostname, witch sometimes not equal to current host.
And i disable SSL checks, because i had self signed certificate.

Install instruction at the mailcow official site - https://docs.mailcow.email/third_party/roundcube/third_party-roundcube/#let-admins-log-into-roundcube-without-password
